    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conda installed on your system\n",
    "- Git\n",
    "- Docker (for supporting services)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create Conda Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the conda environment using the provided environment file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you have CUDA-capable GPU, you can use `environment-cuda.yml` instead for GPU acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Activate the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate infra_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Install Additional Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Some packages need to be installed separately via pip due to conda compatibility issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Core retrieval and NLP packages\n",
    "pip install qdrant-client opensearch-py sentence-transformers spacy pymupdf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Document processing packages\n",
    "pip install pdfplumber unstructured python-docx rank-bm25 rapidfuzz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Verify Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Test that all key packages are working:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -c \"\n",
    "import qdrant_client\n",
    "import opensearchpy\n",
    "import sentence_transformers\n",
    "import spacy\n",
    "import fitz  # PyMuPDF\n",
    "import pdfplumber\n",
    "import unstructured\n",
    "from docx import Document\n",
    "import rank_bm25\n",
    "import rapidfuzz\n",
    "import langchain\n",
    "import llama_index\n",
    "print('âœ… All key packages imported successfully!')\n",
    "\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Set Up Supporting Services (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the vector database and search services using Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Start Qdrant (vector database) and OpenSearch (BM25 search)\n",
    "docker-compose -f docker-compose.rag.yml up -d\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verify services are running\n",
    "docker ps\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start:\n",
    "- **Qdrant** on port 6333 (vector database)\n",
    "- **OpenSearch** on port 9200 (BM25 search engine)\n",
    "- **OpenSearch Dashboards** on port 5601 (web UI)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Environment Activation for Future Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "For future development sessions, simply activate the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate infra_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To update dependencies when new packages are added:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env update -f environment-cpu.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment includes packages for:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Web Framework\n",
    "- **FastAPI**: Modern web framework for APIs\n",
    "- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server\n",
    "- **Pydantic**: Data validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Processing\n",
    "- **PyMuPDF**: PDF processing\n",
    "- **PDFPlumber**: PDF text extraction\n",
    "- **Unstructured**: Document parsing\n",
    "- **lxml**: XML processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Tools\n",
    "- **Black**: Code formatting\n",
    "- **Ruff**: Fast Python linter\n",
    "- **MyPy**: Type checking\n",
    "- **Pytest**: Testing framework\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conda environment creation fails**: \n",
    "   - Try using `environment-cpu.yml` instead of `environment-cuda.yml`\n",
    "   - Update conda: `conda update conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import errors after installation**:\n",
    "   - Ensure you've activated the environment: `conda activate infra-rag`\n",
    "   - Install missing packages individually with pip\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Docker services won't start**:\n",
    "   - Check if ports 6333, 9200, 5601 are available\n",
    "   - Ensure Docker daemon is running\n",
    "\n",
    "### Package Compatibility Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some packages (like `opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi`) had version constraints with Python 3.11\n",
    "- We use compatible versions in the environment files to avoid conflicts\n",
    "- Additional packages are installed via pip after conda environment creation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After environment setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure API keys in `.env` file \n",
    "2. Start the supporting services with Docker\n",
    "3. Run the ingestion pipeline to process your legal documents\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed usage instructions, see the main README.md file."
